# Linear Clock

A linear clock represents time as a straight, continuous line, moving forward without looping back. For someone with ADHD, this concept can be helpful in visualizing tasks or events in a clear, sequential order, making it easier to manage time and stay on track. Unlike a traditional circular clock, a linear clock shows time as a straight path, which can be simpler to follow for planning and focus.
